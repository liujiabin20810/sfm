# Structure from motion 
It is a self project for estimating three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences,which based Bundle.

Here is the difference.

1. Speeding sift  with GPU_GLSL

2. Correct feature match with camera Fundamental matrix.

3. Using [PBA](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/mcba/) for Bundle Adjustment.

The all project file is in the branch.
